    <h2>Temple Architecture</h2>
        <p id="intro">
            Indian temple architecture is broadly categorized into three main styles: Nagara (northern India), Dravida (southern India), and Vesara (Deccan region, a hybrid of the other two). These styles differ in their structural features, including the form of the temple tower (shikhara or vimana), the presence of boundary walls, and the overall plan of the temple.
